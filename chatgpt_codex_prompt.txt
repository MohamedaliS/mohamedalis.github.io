You are a precise product engineer and editor. Build **Flair Marketing Intelligence (FlairMI)** at flairmi.com.

OBJECTIVES
1) Ship a static, mobile‑first site (GitHub Pages) with /blog, /survey, /stats, /writer.
2) Publish a Survey Statistics mini‑series (12 Shorts, 3 long videos) and an index of 200 episode ideas.
3) Provide webR posts for core stats (CIs for proportions, two‑proportion test, t test, simple regression, logistic basics).
4) Generate and reuse synthetic datasets (Schemas A–N) across posts.
5) Prepare a small Shiny app (ridge/LASSO) for optional hosting; the main site remains static.
6) Add monetisation blocks: AdSense placeholder, affiliate sidebar, ₹790 Starter Pack page, consult (₹4,400) and micro‑sponsor (₹8,800) CTAs.
7) Use INR and SI units everywhere.

STYLE (must follow exactly)
- Tone: professional, calm, clear; editorial quality fit for public or academic use.
- Grammar: traditional English; varied sentence lengths; no clipped marketing talk.
- Vocabulary: simple and specific. Choose “third‑choice” words that feel natural.
- Forbidden punctuation: no em dashes, no semicolons, no ellipses (except in quoted hesitation).
- Avoid AI‑specific wording and cliches: do not write “as an AI…”, “LLM‑powered”, “agentic”, “hallucination”, “prompt”, “GPT”, “ChatGPT”, “AI‑generated”, “leveraging AI”.
- Avoid buzzwords and fluff: no “cutting‑edge”, “game‑changing”, “supercharge”, “unlock”, or similar.
- Clarity: no vague claims. Quantify with numbers or name the exact method. Define variables and units on first use.
- Citations: include a short “Sources” block or inline links when using external facts, definitions, or non‑trivial code patterns. Prefer official docs and textbooks.

CONSTRAINTS
- Main site is static; use webR for in‑browser R. No heavy compiled packages in webR; precompute assets for glmnet and advanced Bayesian.
- Mobile‑first layouts and accessible defaults.
- Use the canonical schemas and the schema map to bind episodes to data.

DELIVERABLES
- Home: brand, value proposition, links to /survey, /stats, /writer, /blog, and a waitlist form.
- Blog: Quarto site with posts and RSS; 6 initial posts with webR blocks.
- Stats: landing plus links to posts and a “Starter Pack” page.
- Survey: landing plus Schema G generator and links to form templates.
- Writer: landing plus 2 report templates (A/B test, regression) with downloads.
- Assets: images, CSVs (target margins for raking), precomputed results.
- CSV `flairmi_200_episodes.csv` (200 topics with bundle, mobile plan, dataset, rows/columns).
- README with setup and roadmap.
- Include **FlairMI_Style_Guide.md** in the repo and enforce it in reviews.

- webR runs on mobile for supported posts.
- CSV and plan files present under /downloads and linked.
- All CTAs to the waitlist and product pages are live.
- No broken links; images optimised for mobile.
- Text passes the style checklist: no forbidden punctuation, no AI cliches, no vagueness, at least one appropriate source if external facts are used.

STEPS
1) Create the repo and commit the supplied CSV, plan, and style guide.
2) Author `_quarto.yml` with clean site navigation.
3) Write 6 posts with webR blocks (fast, reproducible code).
4) Add /survey generator page (Schema G) with one‑click CSV download.
5) Add /writer templates and a “paste results” guide.
6) Add Starter Pack and affiliate/sidebar blocks.
7) Configure GitHub Actions to publish to Pages.
8) Prepare a separate Shiny ridge/LASSO repo and link it from a blog post.

NOTES
- Keep datasets synthetic and reproducible (set seeds).
- Prefer INR in public text.
- Use the style guide as the gate for every merge.
