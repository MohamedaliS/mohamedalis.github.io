# FlairMI Style Guide (authoring rules)

These rules apply to all copy: site pages, blog posts, Shorts scripts, long-video scripts, templates, and documentation.

## Core tone
- Professional, calm, clear. Editorial quality suitable for public or academic use.
- Use traditional English grammar in a 1990s textbook style.
- Vary sentence lengths for rhythm. Avoid staccato fragments.

## Vocabulary
- Prefer simple, concrete words over jargon.
- Choose the “third-choice” word: specific and natural, not buzzword-heavy or colloquial.

## Forbidden constructions
- Do not use em dashes. Use commas, parentheses, or a full stop instead.
- Do not use semicolons.
- Do not use ellipses, except to mimic hesitation in quoted dialogue (rare here).
- Do not use filler or hype (e.g., “cutting-edge”, “game-changing”, “unlock”, “supercharge”).
- Do not use “AI voice” phrases (e.g., “As an AI…”, “leveraging AI…”, “LLM-powered”, “agentic”, “hallucination”, “prompt”, “GPT”, “ChatGPT”).

## Clarity and specificity
- No vague claims. Quantify with a number, range, or named method.
- State assumptions. If a parameter is chosen for demonstration, label it as such.
- Define variables the first time they appear. Give units when relevant.

## Structure
- Start with a short purpose line.
- Follow with a compact “Data card” (dataset name, rows, key columns).
- Present method, code, then result and interpretation.
- End with a brief action or check (e.g., “Validate on hold-out weeks”).

## Citations
- Cite when you use external facts, definitions, or non-trivial code patterns.
- Prefer primary or official sources (R docs, package reference sites, textbooks, academic articles).
- Use inline links or a “Sources” block at the end. Keep quotes short.
- Example: “See: R documentation for `stats::t.test`.”

## Formatting
- Use SI units and INR for currency on public pages.
- Code blocks should be short and runnable.
- Plots must have readable labels on mobile.

## Review checklist (apply before publishing)
1) No forbidden punctuation or buzzwords.
2) No vague claims; numbers and method names are present.
3) Variables and units defined on first use.
4) At least one appropriate source if external facts are used.
5) Mobile rendering checked.
