# FlairMI Rollout Sequence and Stage Gates

## Recommended order
1) Blog and Videos in parallel
2) Feedback loop
3) Statistical suite and Writer (MVP)
4) Survey suite (MVP)
5) Book

### Why this order
- Statistical tools and Writer reuse code from posts and run on static hosting. They deliver value quickly.
- Survey suite benefits from a short delay so its exports and schemas align with Writer templates.
- The book is stronger when screenshots, outputs and links are stable.

### 3) Statistical suite and Writer (MVP)
- Three Stats tools live: CI for proportions, two proportion test, simple regression
